                       ************************

This is slippery-chicken, a Common Lisp and CLOS package for
algorithmic composition.

slippery chicken outputs sound files, MIDI files, and score 
files in PDF, Lilypond, and MusicXML formats. It also outputs
scores in [antescofo~](http://repmus.ircam.fr/antescofo) format for use with Arshia Cont's score
following external for Max/MSP.

The source code is available here in github. For more details 
about installation, including pre-compiled binaries and an 
OSX app, as well as extensive documentation see

NB If you're installing this 'by hand' by cloning/downloading
directly from github, be sure to create a directory called
'bin' in the parent of the directory holding these source 
files. See the [wiki page](https://github.com/mdedwards/slippery-chicken/wiki/how-to-install-slippery-chicken-'by-hand')
