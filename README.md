                       ************************

This is slippery-chicken, a Common Lisp and CLOS package for
algorithmic composition.

I use two main branches: 'master' is used only for releases;
'michael' is used all the time whilst developing so can be
seen as the 'bleeding edge'. If I've updated something for
you, you'll find them in 'michael'.

slippery chicken outputs sound files, MIDI files, and score 
files in PDF, Lilypond, and MusicXML formats. It also outputs
scores in antescofo~ format for use with Arshia Cont's score
following external for Max/MSP.

The source code is available here in github. For more details 
about installation, including pre-compiled binaries and an 
OSX app, as well as extensive documentation see
http://www.michael-edwards.org/sc

NB If you're installing this 'by hand' by cloning/downloading
directly from github, be sure to create a directory called
'bin' in the parent of the directory holding these source 
files. See also https://tinyurl.com/y9sb5w4z
