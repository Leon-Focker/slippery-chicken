      <p>The workshops are free and should be useful to experienced composers
        with a variety of backgrounds and styles.  We do recommend you bring
        your own laptop (with <i>slippery chicken</i> already <a
         href="./installation.html">installed</a>) but computers will also be
        available to participants.</p>

        Getting ready for the workshops</h3>

        <p>Please <a href="./installation.html">install</a> <em>slippery
        chicken</em> along with CMN and CLM (if possible on your Operating
        System).  If you're not using the OSX <em>slippery chicken</em>
        application, we recommend SBCL as this is currently the main Lisp
        implementation we use during development.

        <p>In addition, it would be helpful if you would install <a
        href="http://lilypond.org/download.html">Lilypond 2.14.2</a>

        <p>The <em>slippery chicken</em>
      workshops will involve working in the general programming language Common
      Lisp. We recommend that you familiarise yourself with Lisp and install
      <i>slippery chicken</i> on your own computer before attending the
      workshops.  There are links to Lisp implementations on the <a
       href="./installation.html">installation</a> page, and some other
      resources can be found here: </p>

      <ul>

          book <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common
          Lisp</a></li>

      <h4>Workshop exercises</h4> <p> In order to familiarise you with
      <em>slippery chicken</em> during the workshops, several <a
       href="./workshop-exercises.lsp">exercises</a> will be worked on
      individually and as a group.
