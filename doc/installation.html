      <h2>Please Use GitHub</h2>
      <div class="nb">
        Since 2017 slippery chicken uses github to manage its code
        repository. From 2020, due to increasing problems relating to Mac OSX
        apps, slippery-chicken will only be available as a source code
        download. The information and instructions below can be considered
        deprecated. See <a href="https://github.com/mdedwards/slippery-chicken/wiki/how-to-install-slippery-chicken-'by-hand'">
        the github wiki entry</a> for how to install slippery chicken
        and <a href="https://github.com/mdedwards/slippery-chicken/wiki/using-github">using
        github</a> for more information. 
      </div>

      
      <h2>Quickguide</h2>
      <p>If you already have a Lisp interpreter and want to try out the basic
      system, see the <a href="#basic">basic installation</a> instructions
      below.

      <p>Alternatively, there's a wiki entry on <a
      href="https://github.com/mdedwards/slippery-chicken/wiki/how-to-install-slippery-chicken-'by-hand'">how to install slippery chicken 'by hand'</a>.
      

      <p>Macintosh users who don't already have Lisp running on their system
      and want to use <em>slippery chicken</em> to generate sound files with
      CLM might find the <a href="source.html#bottom">application</a> easiest
      to install and use.


      <p>If have Mac OSX or Windows 7 and you're new to Lisp and <em>slippery
      chicken</em> then the easiest version to install is one of the <a
       href="source.html#bottom">pre-compiled images</a>.

      <p class="nb">NB Interaction with
      the pre-compiled images is limited to copy-paste, so you might be
      interested in the 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnWVu8VVDbI">Emacs+Lisp+SLIME
      combination</a>. However, you won't need to install SBCL, rather, when you
      edit your .emacs file, you replace the path to SBCL with
      <code>(setq inferior-lisp-program "/path/to/wx86cl.exe -n -I /path/to/sc.image")</code>.  </p>
           
      <h2>Installing slippery chicken from the source code</h2>

      <p>The rest of this page is devoted to installing <em>slippery
      chicken</em> from the <a href="source.html#bottom">source code</a>.
      <br /><br /></p>

      <p><em>slippery chicken</em> requires an ANSI Common Lisp interpreter for
      use. Many different interpreters are freely available for most operating
      systems (see below), however we only use and test <a
       href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> and <a
       href="http://ccl.clozure.com/">Clozure Common Lisp</a>.</p>

      <p>Interpreter-specific and platform-specific installation details for
        <em>slippery chicken</em> can be found on the page <a
         href="./install-notes.html">install-notes.html</a> in the sc/doc/
        directory and will be updated and expanded as new details become
        available.</p>
          
      <p>Depending on the kind of output desired, the user may be required to
        obtain and install additional software packages prior to
        installing <em>slippery chicken</em>. Please look at the headings below
        to find the appropriate installation guidelines for different
        usages.</p>
          
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>The minimum installation requirements for all purposes are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <em>slippery chicken</em> <a href="./source.html">release
            package</a> 
          
          <p class="nb">NB: <em>slippery chicken</em> uses components of Rick
            Taube's software Common Music 2.6.0 (CM) to generate MIDI files and
            perform a number of other internal processes. A full copy of this
            version of CM is included with the <em>slippery chicken</em>
            release. (Thanks Rick!) Using SBCL or CCL On OSX and Linux,
            <em>slippery chicken</em> loads CM in full, and CM is fully
            functional as a separate package in Lisp. On Windows or in other
            Lisps, <em>slippery chicken</em> loads only a number of required
            components of CM, leaving CM itself not fully functional as an
            independent Lisp package. </p> </li> <li>an ANSI Common Lisp
            interpreter
          
          <p>We test <em>slippery chicken</em> regularly with SBCL and CCL, so

            prompt does not provide the most convenient way of interacting with
            code development and evaluation.  The Lisp-SLIME-Emacs combination
            provides a very slick programming environment so installing Emacs
            with SLIME is highly recommended.  See
            <a href="install-notes.html">install notes</a> for further
            details.</em>

      <p class="nb">NB: Michael Edwards ran <em>slippery chicken</em> on
        Windows XP with CM/CMN/CLM for years but found that the only Lisp/C
        compiler combination that worked with CLM was Allegro Common Lisp and
        Microsoft Visual C++. Both of these are quite expensive pieces of
        software (the free version of Allegro had memory limitations that made
        running CLM impossible). Due to this fact they are currently
        unsupported in <em>slippery chicken</em>. Also, as of May 2013,
        <em>slippery chicken</em> does not work with the current SBCL (1.0.55
        and later) on Windows XP.</p>
      
      <h2>General installation instructions</h2>
      <h3 id="basic">Basic installation&#8212;for MIDI output only</h3>
      <p>This basic setup will allow the creation of MIDI files only:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download and unpack the <em>slippery chicken</em> release
          package. </li>
        <li>Start the Lisp interpreter.</li>  
        <li>Load <em>slippery chicken</em> by entering at the Lisp
          prompt: 
          <pre class="source">
(load "/path/to/sc/src/all.lsp")</pre></li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Installation for printable output</h3>
      <p>For the next two options it is important to note that CMN and/or CLM
        must be loaded into the Lisp environment and working
        properly <em>before</em> loading <em>slippery chicken</em>.</p>

      <p>If <em>slippery chicken</em> has been loaded
        previously <em>without</em> having first loaded CMN and/or CLM, and the
        user would like to install one or both of these programs later, all of
        the files from the <code>sc/bin/</code> folder of the <em>slippery
        chicken</em> release directory must first be deleted, then CMN and/or
        CLM must be loaded into the Lisp environment, and then <em>slippery
        chicken</em> must be loaded again.</p>

      <h3>Installation for music score generation</h3>
      <p>In order to generate printable notation using
        <em>slippery chicken</em>, either LilyPond or CMN must be
        installed.</p>

      <p>For use with LilyPond, first obtain <a
              href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a></li> and follow its
             instructions for installation. <em>slippery chicken</em> can be
             used to produce <code>.ly</code> files via the <a
              href="robodoc/slippery-chicken_lsp.html#slippery2dchicken2fwrite2dlp2ddata2dfor2dall">write-lp-data-for-all</a>
             method and (on some systems) <a
              href="robodoc/slippery-chicken_lsp.html#slippery2dchicken2flp2ddisplay">lp-display</a>
             can be invoked to run Lilypond automatically.  </p>

      <p>In order to use CMN with <em>slippery chicken</em>, first obtain 
        <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/cmn/">CMN</a> and follow
        the instructions in its documentation to load it into the Lisp
        environment. Once CMN has finished compiling and loading, continue by
        following the steps in the "Basic installation" above.</p>

      <pre class="source">
CL-USER> (load "/path/to/cmn/cmn-all.lisp")</pre>

      <h3>Installation for sound file generation</h3>
      <p>In order to use <em>slippery chicken</em> for compositions that
        consist of or include electroacoustic ("tape") parts, CLM must be
        installed.</p>

      <p>Obtain <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/">CLM-4</a>
        and follow the instructions in its documentation to load it into the
        Lisp environment. Once CLM has finished compiling and loading, continue
        by following the steps described in the "Basic installation" above.</p>

      <p>CLM's <code>nrev</code> reverberation instrument must also be compiled
        and loaded in order to use <em>slippery chicken</em> with CLM. To
        compile <code>nrev</code>, first load CLM into the Lisp environment and
        switch to the CLM package: </p>

      <pre class="source">
CL-USER> (load "/path/to/clm-4/all.lisp")
CL-USER> (in-package :clm)
CLM> (compile-file "/path/to/clm-4/nrev.ins")
CLM> (load "/path/to/clm-4/nrev")</pre>

      <p>The <code>nrev</code> instrument must only be compiled once. After
      that it need only be loaded.</p>

      <h2>Running <em>slippery chicken</em></h2>
      <p>If using CMN and/or CLM in a given <em>slippery chicken</em> session,
        these must be loaded prior to loading <em>slippery chicken</em>. A
        typical <em>slippery chicken</em> session in which both CMN and CLM
        are used may start by entering the following at the Lisp prompt:</p>

      <pre class="source">
CL-USER> (load "/path/to/clm-4/all.lisp")
CL-USER> (in-package :clm)
CLM> (load "/path/to/clm-4/nrev")
CLM> (in-package :cl-user)
CL-USER> (load "/path/to/cmn/cmn-all.lisp")
CL-USER> (load "/path/to/sc/src/all.lsp")</pre>

      <p>Emacs+SLIME users can alternatively add those lines of code to their
        <code>.swank</code> file to have them load automatically on startup.
        For example, the basic .swank code on Michael's CCL system would be
        </p>

<pre class="source">
(load "/lisp/cmn/cmn-all.lisp")
(load "/lisp/clm-4/all.lisp")
(load "/Users/medward2/lisp/sc/src/all.lsp")

(in-package :clm)
(compile-file "/lisp/clm-4/nrev.ins")
(load "/lisp/clm-4/nrev.dx32fsl")

</pre>

      <p>Once <em>slippery chicken</em> has been compiled and loaded, switch to
        the <code>sc</code> package by entering <code>(sc)</code> at the prompt
        in the Lisp listener. This changes the prompt symbol
        to <code>SC></code>.</p>

      <pre class="source">
CL-USER&gt; (sc)
(\  }\   
(  \_('&gt; slippery chicken 1.0.0-beta1 (svn revision 1718 2012-05-15 18:14:24)
(__(=_)  
   -&quot;=   
SC&gt; 
</pre>

      <p>To have <em>slippery chicken</em> produce output from previously saved
        files, those files can be loaded at the <code>SC></code> prompt of the
        Lisp listener:</p>

      <pre class="source">
(load "/path/to/sc-file.lsp")</pre>

      <p>A number of example compositions and tutorials can be found in
        the <a href="./manual/index.html">manual</a>.</p>
