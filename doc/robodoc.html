      <p><em>slippery chicken</em> is documented in the form of
        a <a href="./manual/index.html">manual</a> (the main source of discursive
        information and examples), source code documentation (for details on
        individual methods, classes, and functions),
        and <a href="./papers.html">papers</a>.</p>

      <h2>Source code documentation</h2>
      <p><em>slippery chicken's</em> source code is documented inline.  The
        explanatory comments and examples are extracted automatically
        by <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/robodoc/">robodoc</a> to
        produce <a href="robodoc/toc_index.html">webpages</a> and
        a <a href="robodoc/slippery-chicken-manual.pdf">PDF</a>.  These form
        the main source of detailed information on the project's methods,
        classes, and functions.  The PDF is just a collation of the same
        information available on the webpages.  Note that not every method or
        function is documented in this manner, rather, only those which are
        deemed part of the public interface (i.e. useful to the majority
        of <em>slippery chicken</em> users).</p>

      <p>Browse the <a href="./robodoc/toc_index.html">source code
          documentation</a>.</p> 

      <p>Download a
        single <a href="./robodoc/slippery-chicken-manual.pdf">PDF</a> of the source code
        documentation.</p>

      <h3 id="emacs-tags">Accessing documentation in Emacs</h3> <p>As all of
      the source code documentation extracted by robodoc is in the .lsp files
      in the <code>src</code> directory of slippery chicken, to access
      documentation for a particular method or function is very easy in the
      Emacs text editor.  If you place the cursor over the function/method name
      and type alt-. (hold the alt key and type a full-stop/period) the
      minibuffer will prompt you to jump to a tag, the default for which will
      be the function/method name the cursor is over.  Just hit return and
      you'll be taken to the function/method definition in the source code,
      where you should also find extensive documentation and examples.</p>

      <p>This presupposes however that you've generated a TAGS file for the
      source code and so can load this when Emacs prompts you for it.  If you
      don't find TAGS in the slippery chicken source code folder, you can
      generate it by typing the following in your terminal/shell/dos prompt
      (once you've <code>cd</code>'d to the <code>src</code> directory):
      <code>etags *.lsp</code>.  More on tags and Emacs can be found at <a
       href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsTags">emacswiki.org</a>.</p>
