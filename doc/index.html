           aligned hybrid acoustic-electronic pieces of music.

      <br><br><p><i>slippery chicken</i> enables a top-down approach to music
        composition.  The software was originally tailor-made to encapsulate
        the author's personal composition techniques, however many
        general-purpose algorithmic composition tools have been programmed that
        should be useful to a range of composers. The main goal of the project
        is to facilitate a melding of electronic and instrumental sound worlds,
        not just at the sonic but also at the structural level.  Pure
        instrumental or electronic composition is of course possible
        too. Techniques for the innovative combination of rhythm and pitch
        data--arguably one of the most difficult aspects of making convincing
        musical algorithms--are offered.  <i>slippery chicken</i> has no
        graphical user interface and there are no plans to make one. Whilst it
        is clear that this will be off-putting to some, there are many benefits
        to interacting with such a system through the programming language it
        was created in, not least of which is the infinite-extensibility that
        such an approach infers.</p>
