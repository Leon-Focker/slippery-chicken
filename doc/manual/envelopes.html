      <h2>Envelopes</h2>   

      <p>Many of <em>slippery chicken's</em> features allow the user to specify
        predetermined changes to the value of a single parameter over time by
        defining what are known as <em>envelopes</em>. Envelopes in signal
        processing refer to the contour, or <em>curve</em>, created by the
        amplitude peaks of a waveform. This image shows the envelope of the
        given waveform in red: </p>

      <br />
      <table class="image">
        <tr><td><img class="fragment"
                     src="./resources/envelopes-wave-curve.png"
                     alt="envelopes-wave-curve" 
                     width="660"
                     height="120"/></td></tr>
      </table>

      <h4>x-y (or "breakpoint") pairs</h4>
      <p>Since envelopes are linear constructions, they can be described or
        defined by pairs of values, the first of each pair being
        the <em>x-axis</em> value (often representing <em>time</em>) and the
        second being the <em>y-axis</em> value of the envelope at that
        point. For example, in the envelope above, at x-axis 0.000 the envelope
        has a y-axis value of 0.0; at x-axis 0.020 the envelope has a value of
        0.8; at 0.030 the envelope has a value of 0.5, where it remains until
        0.060; and at x-axis 0.100 the envelope returns to a y-value of
        0.0. The following x-y pairs are thus present in the above
        envelope:</p> <br />
      <pre>(0.000 0.0) (0.020 0.8) (0.030 0.5) (0.060 0.5) (0.100 0.0)</pre>
      <br />

      <p>These pairs of x and y values are often referred to as 
        <em>breakpoint pairs</em>, and in <em>slippery chicken</em> they are
        generally given in lists without any extra parentheses, commas, or
        other delineating marks. The envelope from the image above can be
        represented as the following list of breakpoint pairs:</p>

      <pre class="source">
(0.000 0.0 0.020 0.8 0.030 0.5 0.060 0.5 0.100 0.0)</pre>

      <h4>x-values in slippery chicken can have any arbitrary scale</h4>
      <p>The x-values in <em>slippery chicken's</em> envelopes can span any
        arbitrary number range and will be automatically scaled
        accordingly. For example, the x-values from the above image could be
        given as:</p>
      
      <pre class="source">
(0.000 y1 0.020 y2 0.030 y3 0.060 y4 0.100 y5)</pre>

      <p>or</p>

      <pre class="source">
(0.0 y1 0.2 y2 0.3 y3 0.6 y4 1.0 y5)</pre>      

      <p>or</p>

      <pre class="source">
(0 y1 20 y2 30 y3 60 y4 100 y5)</pre>

      <p>or even</p>

      <pre class="source">
(1.0 y1 2772.4001 y2 4158.1 y3 8315.2 y4 13858.0 y5)</pre>

      <p>In each case, the x-axis of the envelope created will start with the
        first x-value and end with the last x-value of the list of breakpoint
        pairs, and the length of each segment of the resulting envelope will be
        scaled to correspond to the remaining x-values in the list.</p>

      <h4>Envelope segments</h4>
      <p>When an envelope is generated based on a user-defined list of
        breakpoint pairs, the resulting curve is created by essentially drawing
        a straight line between each of the y-values in those pairs. This
        produces an envelope with one fewer segments than there are x-y
        pairs. The more breakpoint pairs there are in the list, the more
        segments the resulting curve will have. </p>

      <p>The following envelope is made from the three sets of breakpoint
      pairs:<br />
        <tt>(0 0.0 50 0.9 100 0.3)</tt>. It therefore has two segments:</p>

      <br />
      <table class="image">
        <tr><td><img class="fragment"
                     src="./resources/envelopes-2-segs.png"
                     alt="envelopes-2-segs.png" width="330" /></td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>This envelope is made from the nine sets of breakpoint pairs:<br />
        <tt>(0 76 1 88 2 85 3 85 5 87 8 79 13 72 21 69 30 67)</tt>.<br /> It
        therefore has eight segments:</p>
        
      <br />
      <table class="image">
        <tr><td><img class="fragment"
                     src="./resources/envelopes-8-segs.png"
                     alt="envelopes-8-segs.png" width="330" /></td></tr>
      </table>


      <p>Because envelopes are made of segments, any definition of an envelope
        must consist of <em>at least two</em> breakpoint pairs.</p>

      <h4>Interpolation</h4>
      <p>The breakpoint pairs stipulated by the user only create a finite
        number of points on the envelope's overall final shape. All of the
        other points needed to create the segments between the breakpoints are
        calculated automatically by Lisp
        using <em>interpolation</em>. Different interpolation algorithms will
        produce segments with different shapes, such as exponential or
        hyperbolic curves, or simply straight lines. <em>slippery chicken</em>
        generates the segments for most of its envelopes using straight lines,
        through <em>linear interpolation</em>.</p>

      <h4>Various parameters that are controlled by envelopes</h4>
      <p>Envelopes can be used to control any time-based parameter, not just
        signal amplitude. For example, <em>slippery chicken</em> uses envelopes
        to control features such as the activity levels (playing or resting) of
        the instruments
        in <a href="../robodoc/rthm-chain_lsp.html#rthm2dchain2fmake2drthm2dchain"><code>rthm-chain</code></a>
        objects, to shape the volume of output produced by
        the <a href="../robodoc/slippery-chicken_lsp.html#slippery2dchicken2fclm2dplay"><code>clm-play</code></a>
        method, or to determine the highest and lowest pitches for individual
        instruments (or the whole ensemble) using
        the <code>set-limits-high</code> and <code>set-limits-low</code> slots
        of
        the <a href="../robodoc/slippery-chicken_lsp.html#slippery2dchicken2fmake2dslippery2dchicken"><code>slippery-chicken</code></a>
        class. <em>(NB: In the case of the <code>set-limits-</code> slots, the
        note-name symbols given by the user are first converted to MIDI pitch
        integers so that the interpolation can be performed.)</em></p>

      <p>More on how envelopes are used to influence these features can be
        found in the source code documentation for the individual classes,
        methods, and functions. </p>
