      <p>This page addresses the fundamentals of rhythms in
        <em>slippery chicken</em>, such as naming conventions and how various
        rhythm modifiers are represented. This manual, including the tutorials
        and other pages, will use the American terms for rhythms. Details on
        the differences between British and American note value terminology can
        be found
        at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value</a>.</p>

        <h4>Numeric representation</h4>
        <p>Rhythmic durations in <em>slippery chicken</em> can be represented
          either numerically or through the use of alphabetic rhythm-naming
          conventions similar to those of Common Music and Common Music
          Notation. The numeric representations for rhythmic durations are
          determined by their relationship to a whole note, which is defined to
          be <code>1</code>. Correspondingly, a half note is
          <code>2</code> (two divisions of a whole), a quarter note
          is <code>4</code> (four divisions of a whole), an eighth note
          is <code>8</code>, a sixteenth note is <code>16</code>, a
          thirty-second note is <code>32</code>, and so forth. </p>

        quarter, <code>e</code> = eighth, and <code>s</code> = sixteenth. Grace
        notes are indicated by <code>g</code>. Further long durations are also

        Dots</h3>
      <div id="dots-div" class="more">

      <p>Dotted values are indicated by placing a period after the rhythmic
          value. When using the alphabetic rhythm representations, the period
          can be placed immediately after the letter. Thus, a dotted eighth is
          indicated as <code>e.</code>, a dotted quarter as <code>q.</code>
          etc. When using numbers to represent rhythmic durations, the period
          must be preceded by a backslash to prevent Lisp from reading the dot
          as a decimal point. Thus, a dotted eighth is indicated as
          <code>8\.</code>, a dotted quarter as <code>4\.</code> etc. Any
          number of successive dots can be added simultaneously
          (e.g. <code>e..</code> for a double-dotted eighth). Alternatively
          such rhythms may be entered as strings, e.g. "8."</p>

        <p>Dots function the same way for rests as for notes. </p>

        Ties</h3>
      <div id="ties-div" class="more">

        <p>Ties from one rhythm to the <em>next</em> rhythm are indicated by
          placing a plus sign immediately between two rhythmic values with no
          space between them, such as <code>q+e</code> or
          <code>4+8</code>. Ties from one rhythm to the <em>previous</em>
          rhythm are indicated by placing a plus sign immediately before a
          free-standing rhythmic value, e.g., for placing ties over bar lines.
          When using the alphabetic representations, the plus sign for a tie to
          a previous rhythm can be placed immediately before the letter, such
          as <code>+e</code> or <code>+q</code> etc. When using numbers to
          represent rhythmic durations, the plus sign for a tie to a previous
          rhythm must be preceded by a backslash to prevent Lisp from reading
          it as a "positive" sign. Thus, a free-standing eighth tied to the
          previous rhythm is indicated as <code>\+8</code>, a free-standing
          quarter tied to the previous rhythm as <code>\+4</code> etc. </p>

        Tuplets</h3>
      <div id="tuplets-div" class="more">
        <p>Tuplet rhythms can also be represented either numerically or using
          the alphabetic naming conventions. As with straight rhythms, numeric
          indications for tuplet durations are determined by their relationship
          to a whole note (<code>1</code>). Thus, since there are 12 triplet
          eighths in a whole note, a triplet eighth can be indicated
          by <code>12</code>. A septuplet sixteenth is 1/28th of a whole note,
          and can therefore be indicated as <code>28</code>; a septuplet eighth
          as <code>14</code>, etc.</p>

        <p>The alphabetic nomenclature for triplets and quintuplets consists of
          adding a <code>t</code> (for triplet) or an <code>f</code> (for
          quintuplet, or "five"-tuplet) to the rhythm name. Thus, a triplet
          eighth can be notated <code>te</code> or <code>t8</code>, a
          quintuplet sixteenth as <code>fs</code> or <code>f16</code>, a
          quintuplet eighth as <code>f8</code>, etc.</p>

        <h4>Tuplets must be entered as actual durations</h4>
        <p>As opposed to some other text-based notation systems, such as
          LilyPond, where the tuplet rhythms are entered as their note-type in
          the score (straight eighth, sixteenth etc.) and then automatically
          scaled to their tuplet durations when tuplet indicators such as
          brackets are added, tuplet durations in <em>slippery chicken</em>
          must be entered as their <em>actual</em> durations. Thus, a triplet
          eighth must always be notated as <code>12</code>
          or <code>t8</code>/<code>te</code> rather than just <code>8</code>
          or <code>e</code> inside of tuplet brackets (brackets are explained
          below). This is because <em>slippery chicken</em> processes
          tuplet <em>durations</em> separately from tuplet <em>brackets and
          numbers</em>, rather than using brackets as a flag to scale their
          enclosed durations. This is particularly important when creating
          nested tuplets (as described below.)</p>

<!--
        <h4>Tuplets without brackets and numbers</h4>
        <p>Tuplet durations can therefore be entered without specifying tuplet
          brackets and numbers. </p>

        <h4>Partial-beat tuplets</h4>
        <p>This feature also makes it possible for partial-beat tuplets to be
          placed anywhere in a measure, so long as the sum of all durations in
          that measure produces a complete measure. This can lead to confusion,
          so caution is advised if employing this feature of the software.</p>

        <h4>Tuplet brackets and numbers</h4>

        <p>Since <em>slippery chicken</em> version 1.0.6, tuplets must be
        accompanied by brackets and tuplet numbers. These will then appear in
        the printed score, e.g. as a "3" in a bracket above a triplet figure.
        Curly brackets <code>{}</code> indicate the scope of a tuplet. The
        first number after the opening curly bracket is the number of the
        tuplet; <code>3</code> indicates a triplet, <code>5</code> a
        quintuplet, <code>7</code> a septuplet etc. Explicit ratios such as 7/6
        may also be used; in this case 7:6 will appear in the bracket as
        opposed to merely 7. There must be white space before and after each
        curly bracket of a tuplet, otherwise <em>slippery chicken</em> will
        exit with an error message.</p>

        </table>

        <p>Tuplet brackets can also be placed on partial-beat tuplets, so long
        as the sum of all durations in that measure produces a complete
        measure. However, all tuplet brackets must span at least two events
        (notes/rests); tuplet brackets cannot be placed over just one
        rhythm.</p>

        <pre class="source">
:rthm-seq-palette '((1 ((((2 4) s { 3 te ts } e { 3 t32 t32 } s

        <p>Dots, ties, and rests are indicated the same way for tuplets as for
          straight rhythmic values, for both alphabetic and numeric forms.</p>

        <h4>Nested tuplets</h4>
        <p>Nested tuplets can also be created using <em>slippery
            chicken</em>. As mentioned above, it is particularly important to
            remember that the actual durations of the rhythms must be entered,
            and that straight rhythms are not automatically scaled by enclosing
            them in tuplet brackets.</p>

        <p>For example, to create triplet sixteenths within a triplet eighth,
          one can start by calculating the duration of the triplet eighth,
          which is <code>12</code> (1/12 of a whole note). When one triplet
          eighth is divided into three equal parts, i.e., a triplet within a
          triplet, each of the resulting triplet sixteenths have a duration of
          1/3 of 1/12, or 1/36, and are thus indicated by <code>36</code>: </p>

      <h4 id="rqq">Alternative Tuplet Notation: RQQ</h4>

        <p>The RQQ (Rational Aliquot Quarter?) approach will probably be
        familiar to composers who have worked with IRCAM's Patchwork/OpenMusic,
        especially those with a <em>New Complexity</em> leaning. I first came
        across it in <em>Patchwork</em> in 1995, when I noticed that this piece
        of IRCAM software used Bill Schottstaedt's CMN (also a core part of
        <em>slippery chicken</em>) for the definition of rhythms and their
        rendering into notation. RQQ was Bill's invention, in response to a
        request from (if Bill's memory serves him correctly) Walter Hewlett
        (son of Bill, of Hewlett-Packard fame). IRCAM, specifically Gerard
        Assayag, then made some improvements and incorporated it into their own
        software.</p>

        <p>With RQQ notation, any arbitrarily nested rhythmic structure can be
        expressed in simple proportions. In <em>slippery chicken</em> this kind
        of notation can be used in the definition of <code>rthm-seqs</code> and
        freely mixed with the kind of notation we've been discussing thus
        far:</p>

        <p>Here the definition of rhythms is made via integer divisions of a
        given number of quarter notes. The first example is the simplest. This
        is a 4/4 bar of four quarter notes, but instead of <code>q q q q</code>
        we write <code>(4 (1 1 1 1))</code>. The first 4 in this list indicates
        that we're going to divide up 4 quarter notes. The following list of
        ones indicates that the four quarter note duration will be divided into
        four equal rhythms (i.e. totalling a whole note). So as bar 1 of the
        notation shows, we simply get four quarter notes.</p>

        <p>The second example/bar <code>(4 (1 1 1 (1 (1 1))))</code> proceeds
        similarly but this is where the nesting comes in: the last quarter note
        is subdivided into two equal parts (i.e. eighth notes), as indicated by
        the extra level of nesting here: the list <code>(1 (1 1))</code>.</p>

        <p>The third example <code>(4 (1 1 (2 (1 1 1))))))))</code> shows how
        this type of rhythmic notation can quickly and easily lead to tuplets
        and much more complex rhythmic structures (so-called irrational
        rhythms): Here the 4/4 bar is divided into three parts in the
        proportions 1:1:2. The final 2 (or half note) is itself subdivided into
        three equal parts, hence the triplet quarter notes in the generated
        notation.</p>

        <p>The fourth example takes quite a leap. It shows first of all how
        standard <em>slippery chicken</em> rhythm notation can be mixed with
        RQQ notation: The first and last beats of normal notation frame two
        separate beats of RQQ notation. Each of these occupies a quarter note
        (hence the 1 at the start of both lists) but their subdivisions are
        quite different. <code>((4 (1 (1) 1 1 1)) (5 (1 1 1 1))))</code> is
        interesting first of all as it shows that rests can be indicated in RQQ
        notation just as in normal <em>slippery chicken</em> notation, i.e. by
        placing the rhythmic value in a single element list, here
        <code>(1)</code>. The first RQQ quarter note then is divided into nine
        equal parts (as indicated by the 4 and then the 5 at the start of the
        two sublists and the rendering of this beat as an overall 9:8
        tuplet). The four is further subdivided into five equal parts, hence
        the 5:4 quintuplet bracket in the notation. The five is conversely
        divided into four equal parts, hence the 4:5 tuplet. The second RQQ
        quarter (third beat) division (<code>(1 (1 (3 (1 1 1 1))))</code>)
        necessitates no tuplets as the 1 and 3 indicate that the beat will be
        divided into durations of a sixteenth and a dotted eighth
        respectively. Note that the 1 here has no further subdivisions, hence
        it is rendered in notation as a simple sixteenth, whereas the 3 is
        further subdivided into four equal parts (<code>(1 1 1 1)</code>). The
        <em>slippery chicken</em> software recognises that this can be rendered
        as four dotted 32nds, as opposed to a 4:3 tuplet bracket (also
        acceptable but unnecessary).</p>

      <p class="nb"><em>slippery chicken's</em> RQQ processing does its best to
      work out if some rhythms are better expressed with dots rather than
      tuplets; it also tries hard to get beaming correct. Anyone with experience
      of nested tuplets knows that it's not always obvious how to do these
      things, so sometimes the procedure exits with an error
      (usually it comes from <code>get-tuplet-ratio</code>). Some time in the
      glorious future we'll have code that works in every case even if it can't
      decide the best number of dots and beams, but for now, I apologise if your
      particular RQQ case leaves you stranded.

        Beams</h3>
      <div id="beams-div" class="more">
        <p>By default, <em>slippery chicken</em> produces scores with no
          beams. However, the user can specify where beams are to be placed in
          the typeset output by inserting <code>-</code> (hyphen/minus) signs
          among the rhythm items of the given <code>rthm-seq</code>. Beams are
          specified by placing a hyphen before the first rhythm of the group of
          rhythms that are to be beamed together, thus beginning the beam, and
          a second hyphen after the last rhythm of the group, thereby ending
          the beam. </p>

        <p>Beams can be placed to span over rests that occur between two notes
          in the same beat, but cannot be made to extend over rests that begin
          or end a beat in CMN--in Lilypond this is possible, as are "Stemlets"
          over rests.</p>
