      <h2>slippery chicken and OSC</h2>

      <p class="nb">Available on Mac OSX and Linux with SBCL only:</p>
      
      <p>Using the <a href="../robodoc/osc-sc_lsp.html#osc2dsc2fosc2dcall">
       <code>(osc-call)</code></a> function, <em>slippery chicken</em> can
       receive and evaluate any arbitrary Lisp code sent over a UDP network
       (i.e. via OSC).  The primary application here is to integrate
       <em>slippery chicken</em> and e.g. MaxMSP.  One possibility would be to
       combine the two software systems to generate scores on the fly via an
       interface controlled by musicians.  See the video below for an example
       of this in practice. </p>

            <br />      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315"

      allowfullscreen></iframe>
                  <br />      <br />             <br />      <br />

      <p>For an example MaxMSP patch, see <a
        href="../examples/osc-test.maxpat">osc-test.maxpat</a> (in the examples
        folder of the documentation).  You'll also need
        <a href="../examples/osc-sc-eval.maxpat">osc-sc-eval.maxpat</a>.

       Simon Bahr got this working in PD using the <i>zexy</i>
       and <i>mrpeach</i> libraries. The abstraction you can use
       is <a href="../examples/osc-sc-eval.pd">osc-test.pd</a> (also in the
       examples folder) and the test is
      <a href="../examples/osc-test.pd">osc-sc-eval.pd</a>.</p>


      <p>To get <em>slippery chicken</em> to accept and process Lisp calls over
      OSC, make sure you're in the <em>slippery chicken</em> package and simply
      type <a href="../robodoc/osc-sc_lsp.html#osc2dsc2fosc2dcall">
      <code>(osc-call)</code></a>. At this point the Lisp interpreter gives up
      control to OSC but will process commands as they are received (and print
      them if you call with <code>:print t</code>).  Send a quit
      message (to the osc-sc-eval abstraction if using MaxMSP) to return to the
      Lisp interpreter.</p>

      <p>For those who don't have MaxMSP but would like to use another OSC host
      to communicate with <em>slippery chicken</em>, the following screen shot
      of the osc-sc-eval MaxMSP abstraction should help: <br /> <br />

      </p>

      <h3>Return values</h3>
      <p>Lisp returns the results of function calls via OSC as a list, so the
      most appropriate receiving object (e.g. what's connected to the left
      outlet of osc-sc-eval.maxpat) to display the results is a message
      box. However, connecting straight to any object that can handle numbers is
      fine if your function returns a number. Any function which returns T or
      NIL will automatically be modified to return 1 or 0 instead by
      slippery-chicken's <code>osc-eval</code> Lisp function. More complex
      return objects will probably just return the printed version of their
      internal structure, which is not so useful, so we're really limited to
      simple return types such as lists, symbols, and numbers.

<!--      <p>The video below shows Michael demonstrating the OSC interface
      between MaxMSP and <em>slippery chicken</em>.  The MaxMSP software was
      developed for a new piece where the score is generated according to
      criteria selected by the musician.</p>-->
