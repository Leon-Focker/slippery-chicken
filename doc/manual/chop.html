      <p>The <code>chop</code> method is one of the features of 
	<em>slippery chicken</em> that most embodies its structural marrying of
        computer-generated and instrumental resources. It is essentially a DSP
        technique applied to conventionally notated musical material, dividing
        rhythmic content (and its associated pitch-curves and marks) into
        multiple fragments for further use, much as cutting and splicing of
        audio is used to create loops and other discontinuities.</p>

      <p>The <code>chop</code> method can be used as part of the technique
        of <em>intra-phrasal looping</em>, a process by which the resulting
        fragments are assembled into new sequences using
        the <a href="./fibonacci.html#trans"><code>fibonacci-transitions</code></a>
        function, as described in the tutorial
        on <a href="./intraphrasal-loops.html">intra-phrasal looping</a>.</p>

        Three levels of chop</h3>
      <div id="three-levels-div" class="more">
        <p>The <code>chop</code> method exists for three levels of rhythmic
          classes, namely <code>rthm-seq-bar</code>,
          <code>rthm-seq</code>, and <code>rthm-seq-palette</code>. Most
          users will only need to use and understand the
          <code>rthm-seq-palette</code> version of the method.</p> 

        <p>At the lowest level, the method chops a <code>rthm-seq-bar</code>
          object into fragments, returning a list of
          new <code>rthm-seq-bar</code> objects, each containing one
          fragment. At the <code>rthm-seq</code> level, the method returns a
          list of <code>rthm-seq</code> objects, each of which consists of one
          of the <code>rthm-seq-bar</code> objects created.</p>

        <p>At the <code>rthm-seq-palette</code> level, the <code>chop</code>
          method returns a new <code>rthm-seq-palette</code> with the same
          structure as the original, but with a further level of nesting:
          Each <code>rthm-seq</code> of the original is replaced by a
          (sub-) <code>rthm-seq-palette</code> consisting
          of <code>rthm-seq</code> objects, each of which again consists of
          only one of the <code>rthm-seq-bar</code> objects created by
          fragmenting the original <code>rthm-seq-palette</code>.</p> 

        <p>More detail on the various levels of <code>chop</code> can be found
          in the documentation of the source code for
          <a href="../robodoc/rthm-seq-bar_lsp.html#rthm2dseq2dbar2fchop">

        The chopping unit and chop points</h3>
      <div id="unit-points-div" class="more">
        <p>The <code>chop</code> method fragments the source material on the
          basis of a <em>chopping unit</em> and a collection of <em>chop
          points</em>. The chopping unit must be a duplet rhythmic value
          (e.g. 32, 's, 'e etc.) and an even subdivision of the beat basis for
          the material being chopped (a quarter can be evenly subdivided into
          two 8ths, four 16ths etc.). It cannot be a tuplet value (e.g. 'te,
          'fe, 12 etc.).</p>

        <p>The <em>chop points</em> define the start and end points of segments
          within one beat, each segment being a multiple of the chopping
          unit. Thus, with a chopping unit of a sixteenth, a beat basis of a
          quarter can be segmented into durations of four sixteenths, three
          sixteenths, two sixteenths and one sixteenth. A segment with the
          duration of four sixteenths spans the entire beat.  Segments with the
          duration of three sixteenths can be found from the first to the third
          sixteenth of the beat, and again from the second to the fourth, both
          inclusive. Segments with a duration of two sixteenths can be found
          from the first to the second sixteenth, the second to the third, and
          the third to the fourth, all inclusive. The final subdivision, one
          sixteenth, can be found from the first to the first sixteenth, the
          second to the second, the third to the third, and the fourth to the
          fourth inclusive.</p>

        Chopping the original material</h3>
      <div id="chopping-div" class="more">
        <p>The method then applies this chopping pattern to each beat of the
          original material. For this reason, the method can only be applied to
          material whose time signatures have a denominator that is equal to
          the beat defined by the chop points. For example, if the chop points
          have been defined to segment a quarter note, that instance of the
          method can be applied to any x/4 bar, but not to an x/8 bar. An
          attempt to do so will produce an error.</p>

        <p>As the method passes through the original material, it extracts the
          musical data from each successive segment of the given beat and uses
          that data to create a new <code>rthm-seq</code> containing one
          <code>rthm-seq-bar</code> object. Each of these new bars have the
          same duration as the segment and are assigned a time signature to
          reflect this duration. Thus, any <code>rthm-seq-bar</code> objects
          created from segments with a duration of three sixteenths will have a
          3/16 time signature, those made from segments of two sixteenths will
          have a 1/8 time signature etc.</p>

        <p>The method only creates sounding notes in the
          new <code>rthm-seq-bar</code> objects from <em>attacked notes</em> in
          the original segment. If the original segment contains the sustained
          portions of notes whose attacks occurred in a previous segment, those
          sustained portions are translated into <em>rests</em> in the
          new <code>rthm-seq</code>.</p>

        <p>Thus, when the above <code>chop</code> parameters are applied to this
          original:</p>

		       width="125" /></td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>&hellip;the following ten fragments are created as
          individual <code>rthm-seq-bar</code> objects:</p>

		       width="640" /></td></tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>The method assigns the newly created <code>rthm-seq</code> objects
          sequential numerical IDs so that they can be easily accessed and
          manipulated later, as described below.</p>

        Referencing rthm-seqs in a chopped rthm-seq-palette</h3>
      <div id="refs-div" class="more">
        <p>The additional level of nesting created by <code>chop</code> when
          applied to a <code>rthm-seq-palette</code> makes an additional ID
          necessary in order to reference each <code>rthm-seq</code> object it
          contains. The method creates consecutive numerical IDs automatically
          for each of the new nested <code>rthm-seq</code> objects it
          generates. The new <code>rthm-seq</code> objects can then be accessed
          using a combination of the ID of the original <code>rthm-seq</code>
          object from which the fragment objects were created and the new
          object's own individual ID.</p>

        <p>As an example, the first <code>rthm-seq</code> object created from
          the first fragment of an original <code>rthm-seq</code> object with
          the ID <code>1</code> is accessed using <code>(1 1)</code>, the
          second using <code>(1 2)</code>, the third using <code>(1 3)</code>,
          etc. Correspondingly, the first <code>rthm-seq</code> object created
          from the first fragment of an original <code>rthm-seq</code> object
          with the ID <code>2</code> is accessed using <code>(2 1)</code>, and
          the reference <code>(3 2)</code> would get the
          second <code>rthm-seq</code> object created from the second fragment
          of an original <code>rthm-seq</code> object with the
          ID <code>3</code>, etc. It is important to note here that while the
          IDs of the newly created objects are automatically given consecutive
          numbers, the first ID of these pairs is the ID the user has assigned
          to the original <code>rthm-seq</code> objects and therefore does not
          necessarily need to be a number.</p>

        <p>This code example uses the nested references described above:</p>
