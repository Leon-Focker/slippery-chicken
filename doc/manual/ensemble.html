      <p>This page addresses topics relating to <em>players</em> and
        the <em>ensemble</em>. A separate page is available for information
        specific to <a href="./instruments.html">instruments and
        instrument-palettes</a>.</p>
      
      <h3 id="players"><a href="#players" id="players-div-show"

        Players</h3>
      <div id="players-div" class="more">
        <p><em>slippery chicken</em> distinguishes between <em>players</em>,
          which make up the <em>ensemble</em>, and <em>instruments</em>,
          several of which can be assigned to the same player. For example, the
          same player can double on clarinet and bass clarinet, or one
          percussionist may switch from xylophone to vibraphone at some point
          during the composition. No player can play more than one instrument
          at a given time.</p>

        <p>The players are defined as a list of lists in
          the <code>ensemble</code> block of
          the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function
          (see <a href="#ensemble"
          onclick="jumpShow('ensemble-div')">below</a>). Each player definition
          consists of a user-chosen ID for the player coupled with a list of
          the instruments associated with that player and a value for at least
          the keyword argument <code>:midi-channel</code>, which belongs to
          the <a href="../robodoc/player_lsp.html#player2fmake2dplayer"><code>make-player</code></a>
          function.</p>

        <p class="nb">NB: While the <code>:midi-channel</code> argument is not
          strictly required for players with only one instrument if there is to
          be no MIDI output, it <em>is</em> required for players with more than
          one instrument regardless of whether a MIDI file is created or not,
          and will thus be treated as a required argument for the scope of this
          manual.</p>

        <h4>IDs</h4>
        <p>The IDs used for the players can consist of any arbitrary
          alpha-numeric symbols, and are defined by the user for each
          piece. These IDs must be unique within the scope of the piece.  They
          will be used as a reference from within the <code>rthm-seq-map</code>
          (see the page on
          <a href="./rsp-rsm.html#rsm">rthm-seq-palettes and rthm-seq-maps</a>
          for more detail). If LilyPond is to be used for printable output, the
          names chosen for the players cannot contain numbers
          (e.g. <code>violin-1</code>), as LilyPond's parser does not accept
          them. One option is to use hyphenated alphabetical characters
          instead, such as <code>violin-one</code>.</p>

        <h4>Assigning instruments and chromatic MIDI channels</h4>
        <p>The players can only be assigned existing <code>instrument</code>
          objects from a current <code>instrument-palette</code> (see the page
          on <a href="./instruments.html">instruments and
          instrument-palettes</a> for more detail). The names of the
          instruments listed here must be the IDs of the
          given <code>instrument</code> objects exactly as they are defined in
          the <code>instrument-palette</code> being used.</p>

        <p>The MIDI channel for players with only chromatic material is
          assigned by simply passing an integer to
          the <code>:midi-channel</code> argument. </p>

        <h5>Single instruments</h5>
        <p>If only one instrument is assigned to a player, the given instrument
          can be entered in the same list as the subsequent MIDI channel
          arguments, with no further nesting. An example of a player definition
          with just one instrument (<tt>flute</tt> in this case), which is
          designated for playback on MIDI-channel 1 and which will have no
          microtones, might look like this: </p>

        <pre class="source">
(fl (flute :midi-channel 1))</pre>

        <h5>Doubling instruments</h5>
        <p>If a player is to double on more than one instrument, the names of
          the given instrument objects must be enclosed in a nested list. A
          player definition for a performer that doubles on B-flat clarinet and
          bass clarinet and who will be playing back on MIDI channel 2, with no
          microtones, may look like this: </p>

        <pre class="source">
(cl ((b-flat-clarinet bass-clarinet) :midi-channel 2))</pre>

        <p>If any of the players in the <code>:ensemble</code> block are
          assigned more than one instrument, the user must also define
          an <code>instrument-change-map</code> within the call
          to <code>make-slippery-chicken</code>, as
          described <a href="#change-map"
          onclick="jumpShow('change-map-div')">below</a>.</p>

        <h4>Microtonal MIDI channels</h4> <p>If any of the instruments assigned
        to a player are set as being microtone-capable within their respective
        definitions in the current <code>instrument-palette</code> (see the page
        on <a href="./instruments.html">instruments and instrument-palettes</a>)
        and there are microtonal pitches in any of the pitch sets being used for
        the piece, the player definitions should also specify a value for the
        <code>:microtones-midi-channel</code> argument. (If this isn't specified
        then chromatic and microtonal pitches will be written on the same
        <code>:midi-channel</code>. See also the section on <a href="#mt-chans"
        onclick="jumpShow('mt-chans-div')">MIDI and microtones</a> below.)</p>

        <pre class="source">

        The ensemble</h3>
      <div id="ensemble-div" class="more">
        <p>Ensembles in <em>slippery chicken</em> are assembled
          from <code>players</code>, each of which may be assigned one or more
          <code>instruments</code>. When creating
          an <a href="../robodoc/ensemble_lsp.html"><code>ensemble</code></a>
          within a call to the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function, the
          ensemble is defined using the <code>:ensemble</code> keyword, which
          directly sets the value of the corresponding <code>ensemble</code>
          slot of the resulting <code>slippery-chicken</code> object.</p>

        <p>Defining the ensemble is very straightforward. The list of
          individual player definitions is wrapped in an additional set of
          parentheses and passed as a list to the <code>:ensemble</code>
          keyword of the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function, as
          such: </p>

        <pre class="source">
:ensemble '(((fl ((alto-flute piccolo) 
                  :midi-channel 1 :microtones-midi-channel 2))
             (cl ((b-flat-clarinet bass-clarinet)
                  :midi-channel 3 :microtones-midi-channel 4))
             (hn (french-horn :midi-channel 5 :microtones-midi-channel 6))
             (perc (marimba :midi-channel 7))
             (solo (violin :midi-channel 8 :microtones-midi-channel 9))
             (vln (violin :midi-channel 11 :microtones-midi-channel 12))
             (vla (viola :midi-channel 13 :microtones-midi-channel 14))
             (vc (cello :midi-channel 15 :microtones-midi-channel 16))))</pre>

        <p>Each of the players defined within an ensemble must have a different
          ID. However, different players can play multiple instances of the
          same instrument, as can be seen above in the <code>solo</code>
          and <code>vln</code> players.</p>

        <h4>Influence on score order and pitch selection</h4>
        <p>The order in which the players are listed in
          the <code>ensemble</code> block will be the order in which the
          instruments appear in the score. If not otherwise specified (see the
          section on
          <a href="#hierarchy"
          onclick="jumpShow('hierarchy-div')">instruments-hierarchy</a> below),
          the order in which the players are listed in
          the <code>ensemble</code> block will also be the order in
          which <em>slippery chicken</em> automatically selects pitches for the
          corresponding instruments (see the documentation
          on <a href="./pitches.html#selection">how <em>slippery chicken</em>
          selects pitches</a>). In the above example, for instance, pitches in
          each section would first be selected for the <code>fl</code> player
          (either <code>alto-flute</code> or <code>piccolo</code>, depending on
          the section), then for the <code>cl</code> player etc.</p>

        <p class="nb">NB: An 
          <a href="../robodoc/ensemble_lsp.html#ensemble2fmake2densemble">ensemble</a>
          object created in outside of the scope of and prior to the call to
          the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> can also be passed to
          the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function, for example as a
          variable.</p>

        The instrument-change-map</h3>
      <div id="change-map-div" class="more">
        <p>If any of the players have been defined as doubling on more than one
          instrument, <em>slippery chicken</em> will need
          an <code>instrument-change-map</code> to determine when in the piece
          the doubling players play which of their assigned instruments,
          e.g.: </p>

        <pre class="source">
:instrument-change-map '((1 ((fl ((1 flute) (3 piccolo) (5 flute)))
                             (cl ((1 b-flat-clarinet) (2 bass-clarinet)
                                  (6 b-flat-clarinet)))))
                         (2 ((fl ((2 piccolo) (4 flute)))
                             (cl ((2 bass-clarinet) 
                                  (3 b-flat-clarinet))))))</pre>

        <p>The <code>instrument-change-map</code> takes at its top level a list
          of section IDs. These must be identical to the IDs used in the
          <code>set-map</code> and the <code>rthm-seq-map</code> (see the pages
          on <a href="./pitches.html#set-maps">pitches</a> and <a
           href="./rsp-rsm.html#rsm">rthm-seq-palettes and rthm-seq-maps</a>
          for more details). </p>

        <p>Each section ID is then associated with a list of player IDs that
          are each coupled with a list of 2-item lists consisting of the number
          of a specific <em>sequence</em> within the given section paired with
          the ID of the <code>instrument</code> object that is to be played
          beginning with that sequence. Instruments cannot be changed
          mid-sequence, rather only at the beginning of a new sequence. As with
          the player definitions, the instrument IDs here must be identical to
          those stipulated in the <code>instrument-palette</code> being used
          for the piece. </p>

        <p>In the above example, the <code>fl</code> player begins with
          the <code>flute</code> at sequence 1 of section 1, then changes to
          the <code>piccolo</code> at the beginning of sequence 3 of the same
          section, and back to the <code>flute</code> at sequence 5, and so
          forth. </p>

        <p>An <code>instrument-change-map</code> is always required for all
          players that are assigned more than one instrument within the
          ensemble block, even if the user does not end up having them change
          instruments during the piece. All doubling players must have at least
          an indication for which instrument is to be played in sequence one of
          section one. </p>

        <p class="close"><a href="#" id="change-map-div-hide" class="hideLink"
              onclick="showHide('change-map-div');return false;">close</a></p> 
      </div>

      <h3 id="hierarchy"><a href="#hierarchy-map" id="hierarchy-div-show"
                            onclick="showHide('hierarchy-div');return
                            false;">+</a> 
        instruments-hierarchy</h3>
      <div id="hierarchy-div" class="more">
        <p><em>slippery chicken</em> automatically selects pitches for the
          instruments one player after the next. By default, the order in which
          it does this follows the order in which the players are listed in
          the <code>ensemble</code> block (see the documentation
          on <a href="./pitches.html#selection">how <em>slippery chicken</em>
          selects pitches</a> for more detail on this process). When choosing
          pitches for each instrument, <em>slippery chicken</em> takes into
          account which pitches it has already assigned to other instruments
          that are also playing in that sequence, which limits the pitches
          available to instruments of similar ranges as each player is
          processed. The order in which the instruments are allocated pitches
          can therefore be very important.</p>

        <p>Should the user wish to specify a different order for the automatic
          pitch-selection, the <code>:instruments-hierarchy</code> keyword of
          the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function can be used. This
          order will not affect the order of instruments in the printable
          score. This feature may be helpful, for example, when composing for a
          solo player with ensemble, where the user may desire the solo player
          to be given first preference of pitches even though it appears in the
          middle of the score layout. </p>

        <p>Using the ensemble defined 
          <a href="#ensemble" onclick="jumpShow('ensemble-div')">above</a>,
          such an <code>instruments-hierarchy</code> might be specified, for
          example, as such:</p>

        <pre class="source">
:instruments-hierarchy '(solo vln fl cl vla hn perc vc)</pre>

        <p class="close"><a href="#" id="hierarchy-div-hide" class="hideLink"

                                    false;">+</a>
        MIDI and microtones</h3>
      <div id="mt-chans-div" class="more">

        <p><em>slippery chicken</em> handles microtonal pitch material in MIDI
          output using pitch-bend values. Since MIDI pitch-bend always affects
          an entire channel at once, <em>slippery chicken</em> outputs
          microtonal pitches for each player on a separate MIDI channel to that
          of the player's chromatic pitches, allowing for playback of chords
          consisting of both chromatic and microtonal pitches. If a given player
          is to play microtones in a piece, the user must therefore specify the
          microtone channel in the <code>ensemble</code> block of the
          <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function using the
          <code>:microtones-midi-channel</code> keyword argument. If this isn't
          set, then the <code>:midi-channel</code> will be used for all pitches
          and chords may not be inflected correctly.</p>

        <p class="nb">NB: The generation of musical material that includes
          microtones also requires that the <code>microtones</code> slot of
          the given <code>instrument</code> object is set to <code>T</code> and
          the given set contains microtonal pitches.</p>

        <pre class="source">
:ensemble '(((vln (violin :midi-channel 1 :microtones-midi-channel 2))
             (vla (viola :midi-channel 3 :microtones-midi-channel 4))
             (vc (cello :midi-channel 5 :microtones-midi-channel 6))))</pre>

        <p class="nb">NB: Since slippery chicken version 1.0.9, midi channels
        can be automatically allocated. If the :midi-channel and
        :microtones-midi-channel slots are left out then they will be
        automatically allocated incrementally, e.g.:</p>
        <pre class="source">
:ensemble '(((vln-one violin)
             (vln-two violin)
             (vla viola)
             (vc cello)
             (db double-bass)))         </pre>
        <p class="nb">In this case the channel slots' values will depend on
        whether the current scale is chromatic or not. If chromatic, then
        :midi-channel and :microtones-midi-channel will both be the same. If not
        chromatic, then :microtones-midi-channel will be one higher than
        :midi-channel and each player will occupy two midi channels. In either
        case, midi channel 10 (the percussion channel) will always be
        omitted. This implies that if there are more players than can be
        accommodated by the 15 available midi channels given the current scale,
        then at some point we loop back to channel 1 and start incrementing
        again. This might cause problems during midi file generation, depending
        on whether you generate data for all players at once or in several
        passes. 
        
        <h4>Simultaneous microtones will be of same type</h4>
        <p>Since <em>slippery chicken</em> currently only uses one channel per
          player for microtones, all simultaneously occurring pitches on the
          microtone channel will be of the same type (quarter-tone, sixth-tone,
          or twelfth-tone) regardless of their type in the score. Thus,
          microtonal chords containing mixed microtone types will not render
          correctly in the MIDI output. This does not affect the printable
          output. Linear microtonal pitch sequences consisting of only one
          pitch at a time are not affected by this limitation. </p>

        <p class="nb">NB: Internally, slippery chicken always generates the
          pitch-bend values for MIDI output upwards from the nearest lower
          chromatic pitch, even though this might not be the note-name of the
          pitch printed in the score. For example, the MIDI note number
          generated for <code>GQS4</code> is calculated as a half-semitone
          upwards from <code>G4</code>, while <code>GQF4</code> is calculated
          as a half-semitone upwards from <code>FS4</code>. This allows chords
          consisting of simultaneous microtonal sharps and flats of the same
          type to be rendered correctly in the MIDI output.</p>

        <p class="nb">NB: Due to an issue with Common Music, which <em>slippery
          chicken</em> uses to generate MIDI, the microtone MIDI channels
          currently contain no pitch-bend data. A work-around for this is to
          open the MIDI file in a sequencer and shift the entire channel by the
          desired pitch-bend value.</p>
