      <p>The user's control of rhythms in <em>slippery chicken</em> is
        primarily through the definition of <code>rthm-seq</code> objects
        ("rhythm sequences"). These have a function similar to that of a
        rhythmic motif, or theme, or a series or row. In the simplest case, the
        user defines a palette of fixed sequences of rhythmic durations in
        the <code>rthm-seq-palette</code>, and then determines the order in
        which these occur in the composition by placing their IDs in
        the <code>rthm-seq-map</code>.</p>

      <p>This page addresses the use of the <code>rthm-seq-palette</code>
        and <code>rthm-seq-map</code> in <em>slippery chicken</em>. More detail
        can be found on the specifics of individual rhythm units and their
        corresponding nomenclature on the <a href="./rhythms.html">rhythms</a>
        page.  </p>

                           onclick="showHide('rthm-seq-div');return
                                    false;">+</a> 
        The rthm-seq object</h3>
      <div id="rthm-seq-div" class="more">
        <p>Like the <code>pitch-seq</code> object, the
          <code>rthm-seq</code> is defined within
          the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function without specifying
          the term. It is created internally by
          <em>slippery chicken</em> from the parenthetical expressions
          contained in the <code>rthm-seq-palette</code>. Each individual
          parenthetical expression within a <code>rthm-seq-palette</code> will
          be referred to in this manual as a <code>rthm-seq</code> object, or
          just <code>rthm-seq</code>. Each <code>rthm-seq</code> must be given
          a unique ID, with which it is referenced later from within
          the <code>rthm-seq-map</code>.</p>

        <h4>Measures</h4>
        <p>Each <code>rthm-seq</code> must consist of complete measures. It
          must be at least one measure long, but can be any number of measures
          in length. Each measure within a <code>rthm-seq</code> is enclosed in
          separate parentheses. Each measure can have a different time
          signature, indicated as the upper number of the time signature
          followed by the lower, enclosed in parentheses. If no time signature
          is indicated, the time signature remains the same as that of the
          previous measure.</p>

        <p>This <code>rthm-seq</code>, for example, has the
          ID <code>seq1</code>, and contains 3 measures with two specified time
          signatures: </p>

        <pre class="source">
(seq1 ((((2 4) (s) - s e - - e e -)
        (q - e s s -)
        ((5 8)  - e s s e - q))))</pre>

        <h5>Empty Measures</h5>

        <p>When creating <code>rthm-seq-palettes</code> you can add empty bars
        with the requisite number of rests but the easiest thing to do is simply
        leave them blank:
        <pre class="source">
(5 ((1 ((((3 4) { 7 (28/3) - 28/3 x 6 - })
         ((2 4) (q) g e (e)) ()
         ((5 8)))))))
        </pre>

        <p>Note that two empty bars are created there: the first by a simple
        empty list: (), the second by a change of time signature followed by no
        rhythms ((5 8))

        <h4>Pitch curves</h4>
        <p>One of the fundamental concepts of <em>slippery chicken</em> is a
          marrying of fixed rhythm sequences with indications for linear pitch
          contours. The various linear pitch contours for a piece are therefore
          specified within the definition of each
          individual <code>rthm-seq</code>. Each such pitch contour
          (<code>pitch-seq</code>) is defined within
          the <code>pitch-seq-palette</code> of the given <code>rthm-seq</code>
          and must have exactly the same number of items as there are separate
          rhythms in the <code>rthm-seq</code> (not including tied and rest
          rhythms).</p>

        <p>Multiple <code>pitch-seq</code> objects can be specified for
          each <code>rthm-seq</code>. These contours will only appear in the
          piece in conjunction with the same <code>rthm-seq</code> (see the
          documentation on <a href="pitches.html#curves">understanding
          pitch-seq curves</a> and <a href="pitches.html#multi-ps">multiple
          curves in the same pitch-seq-palette</a> for more detail). </p>

        <p>The above <code>rthm-seq</code>, for example, could be combined with
          the following three <code>pitch-seq</code> objects:</p>

        <pre class="source">
(seq1 ((((2 4) (s) - s e - - e e -)
        (q - e s s -)
        ((5 8)  - e s s e - q))
       :pitch-seq-palette ((5 5 3 3 3 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 1) 
                           (4 6 6 8 6 7 5 6 7 4 2 2 3)
                           (3 4 1 1 1 3 3 2 1 1 2 2 3))))</pre>

        <p>If no <code>pitch-seq-palette</code> is specified for
          a <code>rthm-seq</code> object, <em>slippery chicken</em> will assign
          all rhythms in the sequence the same default pitch from the
          current set. (This can be useful when creating musical
          examples, for instance.)</p>

        <h4>Marks</h4>
        <p>Like the pitch curves associated with a fixed sequence of rhythms,
          many of the marks (articulations, dynamics, slurs etc.) associated
          with those rhythms can also be specified within the definition of
          each individual <code>rthm-seq</code>. This is done using the
          optional <code>marks</code> slot (see the documentation
          on <a href="./marks.html">articulation, dynamics, performance
          indications, and note-heads</a> for more detail).</p>

        <p>The above <code>rthm-seq</code>, for example, could be combined with
          the following <code>marks</code>:</p>

        <pre class="source">
(seq1 ((((2 4) (s) - s e - - e e -)
        (q - e s s -)
        ((5 8)  - e s s e - q))
       :pitch-seq-palette ((5 5 3 3 3 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 1)
                           (4 6 6 8 6 7 5 6 7 4 2 2 3)
                           (3 4 1 1 1 3 3 2 1 1 2 2 3))
       :marks (as 1 te 2 s 3 4 slur 5 6 dim-beg 9 dim-end 13))))</pre>

        <p>More examples of <code>rthm-seq</code> construction can also be
          found on the <a href="./rhythms.html">rhythms</a> page. </p>

        rthm-seq-palette</h3>
      <div id="rsp-div" class="more">
        <p>The user defines all of the possible fixed sequences of rhythms
          (<code>rthm-seq</code> objects) for a composition in
          the <code>rthm-seq-palette</code>. Any number
          of <code>rthm-seq</code> objects can be defined in any order within
          this palette. Each <code>rthm-seq</code> is assigned an ID, which can
          be a number, a symbol, or a string, with which it is later referenced
          from within the <code>rthm-seq-map</code>.</p>

        rthm-seq-map</h3>
      <div id="rsm-div" class="more">
        <p>The <code>rthm-seq-map</code> is where the
          individual <code>rthm-seq</code> objects, with
          their <code>pitch-seq-palettes</code> and <code>marks</code>, are
          assembled into the desired order to create the structure of the
          piece.</p>

        <p>The <code>rthm-seq-map</code> consists of a list of the sections in
          the piece, each of which contains a list of player IDs, as defined in
          the <code>ensemble</code> block of
          the <code>make-slippery-chicken</code> function (see the page
          on <a href="./ensemble.html">players and the ensemble</a> for more
          detail). There must be exactly the same number of sections in this
          map as there are in the <code>set-map</code>, and the section IDs
          must be the same. (More information on the <code>set-map</code> can
          be found on the <a href="./pitches.html#set-maps">pitches</a>
          page.)</p>
          
        <p>Each player is then paired with a list of <code>rthm-seq</code> IDs
          from the <code>rthm-seq-palette</code>.  There must be exactly the
          same number of <code>rthm-seq</code> IDs for each player of each
          section as there are set IDs in the <code>set-map</code> for the
          corresponding section. The <code>rthm-seq</code> IDs can be assigned
          to the players for each section in any order. They can be repeated
          within the <code>rthm-seq-map</code> as many times as the user would
          like. Not all of the <code>rthm-seq</code> objects defined must be
          used in the <code>rthm-seq-map</code>. </p>

        <p>All simultaneously occurring <code>rthm-seq</code> objects in the
          <code>rthm-seq-map</code> must be of equal length&mdash;i.e., they
          must have the same number of bars and same metrical structure.</p>

        <p>An example of a <code>rthm-seq-map</code> for string trio, may look
          like this: </p>

        <pre class="source">
:rthm-seq-map '((1 ((vn (seq3 seq1 seq2))
