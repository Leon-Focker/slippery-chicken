      <h2>FAQ</h2> 
      <p>
      <ol>

        <li><b>Where's the graphical user interface (GUI)?</b><br /> There
        isn't any. To use <em>slippery chicken</em> you have to programme in
        Common Lisp.  See the <a href="installation.html">installation</a> page
        for where to get a Common Lisp environment and <a
         href="workshops.html#getting-ready"><em>Getting ready for the
        workshops</em></a> for some Lisp programming links.</li>

       <li><b>Do I have to be a programmer to use <em>slippery
        chicken</em>?</b><br /> No, but it helps. You do have to programme
        <em>slippery chicken</em> in Lisp but you don't have to be an expert
        programmer to get started and make music with it.  You can start by
        modifying the <a href="manual/index.html">demo compositions</a>.
        See <a
         href="workshops.html#getting-ready"><em>Getting ready for the
        workshops</em></a> for some Lisp programming links.</li>

        <li><b>What's the simplest call to slippery-chicken?</b></li> Some of
        the simplest calls are found in the workshop examples and exercises,
        e.g. the <a href="manual/exercises.html#core">core usage example</a>.
        There's also a <a href="examples/template.lsp">template</a> file to
        help you get started on simple new slippery-chicken pieces.

        <li><b>My piece compiles fine, and I can generate CMN and MIDI files
        OK, but I'm getting Lilypond errors like <em>error: unknown escaped
        string: `\pno' { << \global #(set-accidental-style 'modern) \pno1rh >>
        };</em> what gives?</b></li>
        Lilypond can't handle number characters in players names. If you change
        e.g piano1 to piano-one, all should be fine. See <a
        href="http://michael-edwards.org/sc/manual/coreUsage.html#ensemble">core
        usage</a> for more details.
        <li><b>Where can I see the version history (i.e. all the changes that
        have been made to the software between different releases)?</b></li>
        <a href="version-history.txt">version-history.txt</a>
