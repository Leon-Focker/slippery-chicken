      <h2>Credits</h2> 
      <h3>Michael Edwards</h3>
      <p>Software concept, design, and programming by <a
      href="http://www.michael-edwards.org">Michael Edwards</a>.</p>

      <h3>Sean Reed</h3>
      <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.seanreed.ie">Sean Reed</a>, who was
        responsible for documenting and testing the software prior to
        release.</p>

      <h3>AHRC</h3> 
      <p>The documentation, testing, and release of <em>slippery chicken</em>
        was made possible by a grant from the UK Arts &amp; Humanities Research
        Council <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk">(AHRC)</a> [grant number
        AH/J004529/1].  Work on <em>slippery chicken</em> in 2004/5 was
        supported by an AHRC <em>Small Grant in the Creative and Performing
        Arts</em>.</p>
      
      <h3>ZKM</h3>
